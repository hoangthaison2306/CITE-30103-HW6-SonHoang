Question 12 – Explanation

Code:
    int a = 5, b = 3, res;
    res = a + b << 1;

What happened:
- In C, + has higher precedence than <<.
- Expression is evaluated as: (a + b) << 1.
- So res = (5 + 3) << 1 = 8 << 1 = 16, not 11.

Two corrections:

1) Using parentheses with shift:
    res = a + (b << 1);   // 5 + (3 << 1) = 5 + 6 = 11

2) Using normal arithmetic:
    res = a + 2 * b;      // 5 + 2*3 = 11
