Question 2 – Stages of C Program Translation and Execution

A C program moves from source code to execution in five main stages:

1. Preprocessing
   - The preprocessor handles commands beginning with '#', such as #include and #define.
   - It copies header files into the program and expands macros.
   - Possible error: “fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory”
     This happens if a header file cannot be found.

2. Compilation
   - The compiler translates the preprocessed C code into assembly code.
   - It checks syntax, types, and usage of variables and functions.
   - Possible error: “error: expected ';' before 'return'”
     This happens when the code has a syntax mistake.

3. Assembly
   - The assembler converts assembly instructions into machine code.
   - The output is an object file (.o or .obj).
   - Possible error: “assembler error: invalid instruction”
     This occurs if broken or corrupted assembly code is produced.

4. Linking
   - The linker combines object files and external libraries (such as stdio).
   - It resolves function references like printf() or scanf().
   - Possible error: “undefined reference to 'printf'”
     This occurs when the standard library or other required object files are missing.

5. Loading
   - The loader loads the final executable into memory for execution.
   - It prepares memory layout (stack, heap, code segment).
   - Possible error: “Segmentation fault (core dumped)”
     This happens if the program is loaded or executed incorrectly.

Each of these stages must complete successfully for the program to run.
